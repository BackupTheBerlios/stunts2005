we need a installed Ogre-1.02 and boost boost-1.32.0-r4
 and an extracted fmod sound library

---

cegui_mk2-0.3.0 - cegui_mk2_stunts_release.tar.bz2:

-> extract Ogre 1.02 (you get the ogrenew directory)
-> extract cegui_mk2_stunts_release.tar.bz2 to ogrenew/Samples/Common
-> cd ogrenew/Samples/Common/cegui_mk2-0.3.0
-> touch NEWS
-> make -f Makefile.cvs
-> ./configure
-> make
-> make install (as root)

---

CEGUIRenderer - CEGUIRenderer-Ogre1_02.tar.gz:

-> cegui_mk2-0.3.0 has to be installed and you have the ogrenew directory
-> rm -r ogrenew/Samples/Common/CEGUIRenderer
-> extract CEGUIRenderer-Ogre1_02.tar.gz to ogrenew/Samples/Common
-> cd ogrenew
-> ./bootstrap
-> ./configure
-> cd ogrenew/Samples/Common/CEGUIRenderer
-> make (Makefile must exist after ./configure)
-> make install (as root)

---

ODE and OgreODE - OgreOde_1-0-1-r1.tar.gz:

-> extract CEGUIRenderer-Ogre1_02.tar.gz to ogrenew
-> sh install.sh (it leads you through the setup process, install it to /usr/local/)
-> cp ogrenew/OgreOde_1-0-1-r1/prefab/include/OgreOdeRagdoll.h  /usr/local/include/OgreOde_Prefab

---

Take the following paths to your environment variables:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/<FMOD path>/:/<nrEngine path>/lib/:/usr/local/lib/
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/<nrEngine path>/include/:/<FMOD path>/inc/:/usr/include/OGRE:/usr/local/include/OgreOde_Core:/usr/local/include/OgreOde_Prefab
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

---

Stunts:

-> checkout the stunts module
-> cd stunts
-> make -f Makefile.cvs
-> ./configure (no error may occur there)
-> make

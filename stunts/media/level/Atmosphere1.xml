				Lights normally get fainter the further they are away.

				range -The absolute upper range of the light in world units 
				constant  -The constant factor in the attenuation formula: 1.0 means never attenuate, 0.0 is complete attenuation 
				linear - The linear factor in the attenuation formula: 1 means attenuate evenly over the distance 
				quadratic  - The quadratic factor in the attenuation formula: adds a curvature to the attenuation formula.
